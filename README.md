# Introduction
This is an example of a simple Rest API to perform basic CRUD operations using Node and ExpressJS.
I have utilized the Nodemon packag to immediately reflect the updates made in the any respective file.

# Setup
A seperate controller folder is being created in order to abstract away the logic for the callback functions.
The routes folder contains all the different GET, POST, DELETE, PATCH API endpoints for handling incoming requests.

# Technologies Used:
The Rest API is build using Node JS and Express JS, it also uses the Uuid package for generating unique ID's.
