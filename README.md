# Introduction
This is an example of a simple Rest API to perform basic CRUD operations using NodeJS and ExpressJS.
Nodemon package is used to immediately reflect the updates made in the file.

# Setup
A seperate controller folder is being created in order to abstract away the logic for the callback functions.
The routes folder contains all the different GET, POST, DELETE, PATCH API endpoints for handling requests.
