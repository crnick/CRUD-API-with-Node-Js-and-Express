# Simple REST API with Node.js and Express.js
This is a simple REST API built using Node.js and Express.js to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The project uses the Nodemon package to automatically reload the server when changes are made, and UUID to generate unique IDs for resources.

## Technologies Used
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

- Express.js: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.

- Nodemon: A utility that monitors for changes in your source code and automatically restarts the server.
